A lot of self-taught people expend a lot of energy trying to memorize some concepts that are important in their learning process. The problem's origin use to be the absence of any pedagogical method or strategy.  I decided to create LearnWell tool, API inspired by the Leitner System and It will allow you to create questionnaires which, after a period of study help you remember the new learnings. The play rules are the following.

* Only registered users can create questionnaires
* All users  will be able reading public questionnaires
* For the study, the users will be able to read only the questions without their answers.

The Second Version of this API will include a Google Calendar integration that offers you an evidence-based learning technique named Spaced Repetition. It allows you to create intervals of time reminders to review these concepts.
